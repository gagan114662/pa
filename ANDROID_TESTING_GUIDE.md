```bash
# Check installation
adb shell pm list packages | grep com.blurr.voice

# If not found, reinstall:
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Check for permission issues
adb logcat -s PackageManager:E | grep com.blurr.voice

# Grant all permissions
adb shell pm grant com.blurr.voice android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
# (repeat for all permissions)
```

#### Issue 2: Accessibility Service Not Working
